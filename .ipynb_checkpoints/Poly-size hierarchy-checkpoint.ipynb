    "The polynomial-hierarchy is well known hierarchy of classes defined for turing machines. For turing machines, the polynomial hierarchy is defined using three concepts: 1. Oracle 2. Relations 3. Alternating turing machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to consider the analogy of polynomial hierarchy within two-way finite automata, we are interested in *polysize hierarchy.* In the world of finite automata, concept of time bear little meaning because all computations are done in polynomial time. What is interesting, however, is the size of the automata. We are interested in automata that have small number of states, and thus, we explore the context of \"polysize hierarhcy,\" where the two-way finite automata can only have polynomial number of states.\n",

    "The polysize hierarchy has been defined in terms of relations and alternating turing machines. It hasn't been defined in terms of oracles yet. Goal of this research is to define polysize hierarchy in terms of oracles.\n",
